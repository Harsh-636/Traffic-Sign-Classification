# Traffic-Sign-Classification
CNN model built using TensorFlow and Keras for the purpose of detection of traffic signs.

# Setting up
1. [Download the GTSRB dataset from here.](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/kernels)
2. Place the above files in the folder just downloaded, containing train, test, and meta folders.
3. Run the notebook to generate the Keras model(95% accuracy can be achieved with pre-made layers).
4. The last block of the notebook can be used to generate a TensorFlowLite model for use in mobile devices.

Feel free to use the model on different datasets, and do share your work with us!
